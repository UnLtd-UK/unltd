name: Defining social impact indicators, setting targets and refining your social model
description: UnLtd finds, funds and supports social entrepreneurs - enterprising people with solutions that change our society for the better. We were formed in 2002 by seven organisations who believed that social entrepreneurs had a much bigger contribution to make to our economy and society. We were among the first to back individuals with their own ideas to create social good.

UnLtd's Awards are funded by the income generated from an endowment from the Millennium Commission. This legacy is carefully invested so that it generates income to fund our awards for years to come.

Since we were founded, we have learned a lot about what is needed for social entrepreneurs to create the change they want to see. We have grown our support beyond our core awards, helping to accelerate the impact of scaling ventures. We have identified areas where we are well placed to create change, and focused our efforts where it can make the biggest difference. We have identified barriers faced by social entrepreneurs and look to tackle them through research, policy work and our campaigns. And we have realised that we cannot do it alone, seeking committed partners and funders who share our vision.

We're very proud of the work we've done so far. We hope you'll join us for the next stage of our journey.

## Why we do it

Enterprising people with solutions are out there driving lasting social change. UnLtd's funding and support helps them start up and scale their impact.

But we see a future where we can achieve so much more. Where people, communities and society aren't just surviving, but thriving thanks to innovative, sustainable ideas designed with lived experience.

Social entrepreneurs have a big role to play in tackling some of the monumental challenges we face today. Challenges like a UK population ageing so fast, that by 2040 close to one in four of us will be aged 65 and over. Like the fact that disabled people are more than twice as likely to be out of work than non-disabled people. That homelessness rose by 169% in the UK between 2010 and 2018. And that public services are stretched and set to contract even further.

So that social entrepreneurs can achieve this potential, UnLtd campaigns to break down the barriers they face: such as finding customers, making a living, and getting access to finance. We set out to change the system so it works better for those who set out to change society. And we need to your help to do it.
