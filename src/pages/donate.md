We believe the best way to support social entrepreneurs is to invest directly in them, providing them with financial and non-financial support. But there is still so much more we can do.

Our social entrepreneurs face all kinds to barriers to making their venture a success. From raising the right kinds of capital, developing successful routes to market, accessing specialist advice, evidencing their impact, finding the right staff through to simply making a living.

With your backing, we want to help them break down some of these barriers, giving social entrepreneurs the opportunity to flourish and have the greatest social impact they can.

Whether your philanthropy is in the form of a donation, shares or a contribution in your will, making a significant gift to UnLtd will help us to provide the support and services our social entrepreneurs need to succeed and make a difference.

In return, you’ll get to meet some of the social entrepreneurs your gift is helping to support and we’ll make sure you receive regular reports on how your gift is helping UnLtd’s work. You’ll also get to meet other donors and partners at many of UnLtd’s events.

## Gift aid

If you are a UK taxpayer your gift can be further enhanced through the Gift Aid scheme.

When a donation is made under the Gift Aid scheme, UnLtd is able to reclaim the income tax that you have already paid on the amount of the gift.

There is no extra cost incurred to you. To be able to claim Gift Aid on your donation, you must pay income or capital gains tax equivalent to the amount we reclaim.

All you have to do is complete a simple form saying that you are an income or capital gains taxpayer and this will cover all of the donations you have made in the past six years and any future donations. You only have to complete this form once.

Higher-rate taxpayers also get to claim back the difference between the basic and higher rates.
