# Partner

If you would like to find out more about partnering with UnLtd to support social entrepreneurs and the change they make, please contact our Partnerships Team at [Partnerships@unltd.org.uk](mailto:Partnerships@unltd.org.uk).

We work to help social entrepreneurs tackle the issues that they care about. And create impact that makes the UK an even better place to live.

We work with a range of partners to make this happen. From delivery partners who enable us to support social entrepreneurs in specialised ways, to partners who give financial and non-financial resources so that we can broaden the impact of our support.

Whether you are a corporate organisation, a trust or a foundation, we will work with you to design and tailor our partnership for mutual benefit to both organisations. UnLtd is experienced at working with partners on multi-year programmes to maximise the impact for social entrepreneurs and the change they are trying to make.

Working in partnership with us not only helps to meet social responsibility objectives, but can also motivate staff , build support in the communities in which you operate, while supporting a positive PR and brand profile.

At the same time, you can be confident that our partnership will be supported by expert account management and our award-winning communications team.

And our Impact and Evaluation team will ensure that you can be confident that your support is making a significant impact on how social entrepreneurs are changing the society we live in.

## Other ways to partner with UnLtd

### Delivery partners

Our delivery partners help us offer social entrepreneurs the support they need. They might offer expert advice to specific kinds of social entrepreneurs such as young people or graduates, have industry knowledge or provide local expertise. They can help us reach out to social entrepreneurs in areas where we're not as well connected.

### Influential partners

We want to hear from those with expertise or the knowledge to help us take social entrepreneurship mainstream in the UK. We work with government, businesses and other specialist organisations to help us achieve this. Find out more about our past and current campaigns.

### Pro-bono partners

Social entrepreneurs can often feel isolated or not know where to turn for advice or specific skills. Our volunteering and pro-bono partners offer their expertise with social entrepreneurs through mentoring or skills sharing. Staff get to give-back, learn new skills and lighten the load for a social entrepreneur.
