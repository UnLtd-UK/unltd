## What we're looking for

Mentors can be professionals with expert knowledge, or social entrepreneurs who have successfully grown their venture and want to help someone else trying to do the same.

- Business skills and commercial expertise
  We look for mentors with experience and practical know-how. Mentors can be based anywhere in the UK and have a range of different experience: business consulting, marketing and PR, legal, finance, IT, HR or academia. Many run their own business. Others use business skills in their job. Some are a social entrepreneurs.
  Self awareness and emotional intelligence

- A good mentor is aware of their own strengths and weaknesses. This helps them to be an open sounding board for the social entrepreneur. Our mentors are comfortable delivering the benefits of their experience. When our mentors share their experience, they do it openly and honestly.

- The ability to listen and ask good questions
  Mentoring is about helping others to reach their own decisions. Our mentors must be good listeners. They need to be able to ask probing questions that challenge, stretch, encourage and guide, but avoid telling social entrepreneurs.

- Strong interpersonal skills
  Mentoring partnerships are usually made or broken in the first couple of meetings - depending on whether the mentor and social entrepreneur get on. Our mentors have strong interpersonal skills and are comfortable meeting a social entrepreneur who may have a different background and life experiences.
