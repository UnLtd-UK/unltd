Transform Ageing aimed to revolutionise the approach to health, wellbeing and social care for people in later life, starting in the south-west of England.

The initiative was funded by The National Lottery Community Fund and was a driving pioneering programme taking a community and design led approach to improve people's experience of ageing in the UK. The initiative brought together people in later life, their friends, family, social care leaders, social entrepreneurs and policy sector leaders to define, develop and deliver new solutions that better support the needs and aspiration of ageing communities.

What were the main challenges?
------------------------------

Given the demographic shift the UK is experiencing Transform Ageing worked to ensure that we found the best innovations to change the lives of people in later life. To do this:

-   We enabled people in later life and their support network to feel able to contribute to how and what services are commissioned in their community.
-   We brought together people in later life and social entrepreneurs with ideas to transform ageing.
-   We backed 62 high potential social ventures from across the country at start up and scale up, offering a comprehensive package of funding and support.
-   We work with local healthcare commissioners to drive adoption and create impact.
-   We convened a national network of supporters to contribute to and learn from our work.


Later life is for living

The social entrepreneurs

What did we do?
---------------

We developed six innovation briefs for ambitious social entrepreneurs to apply their creative expertise to in Somerset, Devon, Torbay and Cornwall.

-   **Steps to a positive future**

    People in later life have positive experiences of ageing

-   **Mobility and transport**

    Enhancing independence and wellbeing through improved mobility

-   **Life Transitions**

    Supporting people to prepare for life changes

-   **Caring about carers**

    Supporting, valuing and celebrating carers

-   **Right information, right time**

    Making information accessible, relevant and meaningful

-   **Making connections**

    Creating opportunities for people in later life to connect\
    with other people, communities and activities

Each innovation brief was developed in collaboration with local people to capture their perspectives, experiences and insights into what will make a difference in their communities.

The briefs are designed to encourage social entrepreneurs from the south-west and around the UK to launch new services or products in the region, to directly meet the needs and desires of local people.

### The support offer

We worked with 62 social entrepreneurs and sought for innovations that support us as we age, to stay active, healthy and connected. Social entrepreneurs benefited from:

-   Making difference not only to individuals but to entire communities.
-   A financial award to help them develop and grow their idea.
-   Dedicated 1-2-1 tailored support through the Transform Ageing programme.
-   Access to experts in a range of fields including business, design, and finance who helped them develop and strength their idea.
-   Their social venture being celebrated and showcased via national and local media as well as online and on social media.
-   Our collaborative approach allowed those on the programme initiative to explore new markets and meet new people and organisations, helping them to further grow as a social entrepreneur.
-   Full guidance and support to identify further areas of investment and growth in their social venture.

#### Who has been involved?

Transform Ageing was funded by The National Lottery Community Fund and run in partnership with the Design Council, the South West Academic Health Science Network and the Centre for Ageing Better.
