We want to improve the health and wellbeing of 135,000 marginalised older adults whilst reducing health inequalities across the UK.

The UK is undergoing a major demographic shift, with far-reaching consequences for society, the economy and public services. **Longer life expectancy, one of the great triumphs of the last century**, has not been matched by an equal rise in the quality of those extra years. 

Although average life expectancy at birth is now 80 years, 'healthy life expectancy', the number of years lived in a healthy and active state, is only 63 years. **We are living longer but we are not living better**, and the discrepancy in healthy life expectancy between different areas of the UK can be as much as 20 years.

Despite the scale of the challenges, **social businesses can and are significantly improving the experience of later life in the UK**. By providing products and services that meet the needs and aspirations of people in later life, social businesses can significantly improve the experience of later life in the UK.

## Aims

-   Improve the health, wellbeing and connectedness of older adults

-   Reduce health inequalities between different groups of older adults

-   We want to improve the health and wellbeing of 135,000 marginalised older adults and reduce health inequalities by working in the ten areas of lowest healthy life expectancy in the UK.

-   We want to find, fund and support up to 180 of the most impactful and diverse social entrepreneurs to start and scale ventures that meet high levels of unmet health needs in these areas. 50% of these entrepreneurs will be Black, Asian or Minority Ethnic, or Disabled People.

-   We want to shift public policy to focus on prevention, positioning social entrepreneurs as the best providers of preventative innovations in the UK supporting our [Breaking Down Barriers](https://breakingdownbarriers.unltd.org.uk/) agenda.
