You can use this template to submit all your financial data, which includes:

historical financial data (last 12 months)
a financial forecast (next 12 months), and
financial assumptions.

## Historical financial data

Start by providing us with your venture's historical data.

Click on the “Last 12 months” tab.

When you see instructions in italics (like this) complete the relevant task using the template provided. Sometimes you will also need to use a calculator and a notebook or the notes app on your computer.

Tabs are found at the bottom of the spreadsheet.

The amount in the field “Total Income - Expenditure” for the most recent month should match the current figure in your bank account.

If these figures do not match, you will need to check your income and expenditure figures to find the error. You may have forgotten to include an item.

After completing your historical data, you are ready to make a forecast of your venture's financial future.

## What is a financial forecast (and why does it matter)?

A financial forecast is a plan that sets out two things:
- how you expect your venture to gain income, and
- what you expect your venture to spend money on (called “expenditures”).
Preparing a financial forecast gives you an opportunity to consider the future of the venture.

### List your financial assumptions
**Start your forecast by listing assumptions about the future performance of your venture in the tab labelled “Assumptions”.**

Use your business plan to generate a list of expected income and expenditures in the provided tables.

Assumptions about your income and expenditures should be detailed and realistic. Tell us what your assumptions are based on (for example, the previous performance of your venture, market research, or data insights).

### Income

Describe the income source and the amount you expect it to generate. Income may come from sales of products and services, as well as grants and donations.

### Expenditures

Also called “costs”. Describe the type and amount of expenditures you expect your venture to involve. Expenditures may include rent, salaries, equipment, material, and legal costs.

Now that you have a list of assumptions about your venture's income sources and costs, you can use theme to produce a financial forecast.

Use the tab labelled “Next 12 months”.

### Sales budget

Start your forecast by using a sales budget to calculate the income you will generate from sales of products and services.

A sales budget lists every type of product or service you offer.

It then calculates how much income you can expect by multiplying the number of items of each type by the price you will charge for each item.

Sales budget formula:
Number of items you expect to sell
X Price you will charge for each item
= Income you will generate from that item

For example, if your venture offers group training sessions for £120, and you expect to sell 6 group training sessions in Month 1, then your income from all training sessions for that month will total £720.

Here is how to complete a sales budget.

Start with an item you will sell and write its name in the income section of the financial forecast.
