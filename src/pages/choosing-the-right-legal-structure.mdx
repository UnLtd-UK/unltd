This guide explores the typical legal structures that are used in the social enterprise sector, the core advantages and disadvantages of the respective structures, and the key issues for consideration when deciding on the right legal structure for your organisation.

As there is no legal definition for what constitutes a social venture, there is considerable scope for choosing from a variety of different legal forms (although there are numerous viewpoints of what constitutes the 'best' social venture legal structure, often driven by vested interests). Before getting into the detail, it's worth bearing in mind two fundamental principles:

- It is not the legal structure that makes an organisation a social venture - it is its activities.
- Your immediate, and future, funding and income generating opportunities will have a major impact on the structure you choose.

An individual operating a social venture without a legal structure is usually regarded as a sole trader or self employed. Organisations that are operating as a membership body without a legal structure are typically regarded as an unincorporated association (also known as voluntary association and community groups). There are a number of reasons why you might consider adopting a legal structure for you organisation:

- A requirement by stakeholders that you are planning to engage with
- A requirement based on the type of activities you plan to undertake
- To enhance your credibility with customers, funders, suppliers and employees
- To protect individuals involved from personal liability.

As a sole trader, self employed individual or unincorporated association (i.e. not recognised as a separate legal entity), the individual or management committee of the association is directly liable for any debts or legal actions affecting your organisation- a risky position. For example, if the organisation generates a financial deficit, it will be the responsibility of the individuals involved to find the money to pay any creditors. Adopting a formal legal structure can protect individuals (e.g. members/ trustees/ directors) from personal liability, therefore limiting this type of risk.

The variety and diversity of the possible legal structures for social enterprise complicates matters. However, there are a number of over-riding principles that should be considered; thinking through these should help you decide the best legal form to adopt for your project. After looking at the different possible legal structures, we'll address some of these considerations.

## Common legal structures
The most common legal structures used in the social entrepreneurship sector are:

- Unincorporated association (which may also be a registered charity)
