          />

          <Faq
            question="I registered my venture more than four years ago but started trading less than four years ago. Can I apply?"
            answer="We check the date of registration on Companies House/Charity Commission during our assessment. If your venture has been registered for longer than four years at the time of your application, you are ineligible to apply for our awards."
          />

          <Faq
            question="Does the legal structure of my venture matter?"

          <Faq
            question="Does my idea/venture sound like the type of application UnLtd could support?"
            answer="We aim to support people who are creating or developing ventures which have the most potential to create positive social change. By social venture, we mean an organisation which creates social impact but has a business model that is financially sustainable so that it can continue to make a difference. You can read more about this in our 2025 strategy, Breaking Down Barriers."
          />

          <Faq
            question="Can I speak to a member of staff about my idea/venture?"
            answer="We aim for our award making to be as equitable as possible, so we are unable to advise you on your idea or your venture and we cannot tell you if your application would be successful or give specific advice before you apply. Our focus is on assisting those with additional support needs to access our application process."
          />

          <Faq
            question="What support can you offer if I have additional needs, or I am facing barriers in applying?"
            answer="To accommodate different accessibility needs we can be asked to make changes to our process to give people the best chance of communicating their idea and plans with us. This could be arranging a conversation with a member of the team to provide clarity on the questions and process, providing information in accessible formats or working with you to make available a BSL interpreter, for example. We are happy to consider any requests for accessibility that might reduce barriers to applying."
          />
