The purpose of the UnLtd Complaints policy is to set out how we will investigate complaints made by individuals.

Our aim is to listen, resolve any issues to enable our organisation to learn from any mistakes. In this way we will be able to improve our services in the future.

If you have a complaint you should send an email to the Director of Social Entrepreneur Support, clearly stating the nature of your complaint, providing any evidence you have.

Our Director of Social Entrepreneur Support can be contacted at [deniseramsey@unltd.org.uk](mailto:deniseramsey@unltd.org.uk)

The Director of Social Entrepreneur Support will acknowledge receipt of your complaint within five working days of it being received.

The Director of Social Entrepreneur Support will need a little time to investigate the matters which are raised but usually you will receive a direct reply within two weeks.

If having received a reply from the Director of Social Entrepreneur Support, you are still not satisfied you should write to the Chief Executive of UnLtd.

Our Chief Executive can be contacted via [alexmurtough@unltd.org.uk](mailtio:alexmurtough@unltd.org.uk)

The Chief Executive will acknowledge receipt of your complaint within five working days of receiving it. He will investigate your complaint and reach a decision on action to be taken, usually within two weeks. He will write to you and let you know his decision. The decision of the Chief Executive is final.

If at any stage your complaint is upheld, we will provide an explanation. We will also share detail of action we will put in place to ensure the same thing will not happen again and take action to put things right.

The Chief Executive will report all complaints to UnLtd’sTrustees on our Awards and Delivery Committee. The Trustee members on this Committee will review all complaints and action taken. All Trustees will receive this information at their next Board meeting and a record of complaints is included in UnLtd’s Annual Report.

The Awards and Delivery Committee are responsible for the approval of a range of Awards. There is no right of appeal against decisions taken by the Awards and Delivery Committee on individual applications for Awards.
