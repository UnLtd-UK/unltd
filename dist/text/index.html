            <b>Does my idea/venture sound like the type of application UnLtd could support?</b>
        </p>

        <div class="answer">
            <p>We aim to support people who are creating or developing ventures which have the most potential to create positive social change. By social venture, we mean an organisation which creates social impact but has a business model that is financially sustainable so that it can continue to make a difference. You can read more about this in our 2025 strategy, <a href="https://breakingdownbarriers.unltd.org.uk/" target="_blank">Breaking Down Barriers</a>.</p>

            <b>What support can you offer if I have additional needs, or I am facing barriers in applying?</b>
        </p>

        <div class="answer">
            <p>To accommodate different accessibility needs we can be asked to make changes to our process to give people the best chance of communicating their idea and plans with us. This could be arranging a conversation with a member of the team to provide clarity on the questions and process, providing information in accessible formats or working with you to make available a BSL interpreter, for example. We are happy to consider any requests for accessibility that might reduce barriers to applying.</p>
